# rdftools

:package: Common utilities for RDF.  Currently the package merely provides a `write_nquads` S3 method for `data.frame` and `list` objects to coerce them into the [N-Quads format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Triples#N-Quads).  Additional utilities may be added at a later date.

## Installation

You can install the released version of rdftools from GitHub with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("cboettig/rdftools")
```

## Basic utilities

`rdftools` can write `data.frame` and `list` objects into the Resource Description Format (RDF) as an `nquads` file.  This can then be imported into common RDF Databases. See [virtuoso](https://github.com/cboettig/virtuoso) or [rdflib](https://github.com/ropensci/rdflib) for examples importing `nquads` files and working with RDF.

```{r}
library(rdftools)
```

```{r}
write_nquads(iris, "iris.nq", prefix = "iris")
```

```{r}
x <- list(A1 = list(B = 1, C = 2), A2 = "bob")
write_nquads(x, "a_list.nq", prefix = "x")
```


## Experimental DSL

`rdftools` also hosts an experimental DSL for constructing SPARQL queries. 

```{r}
```


```{r include=FALSE}
unlink("iris.nq")
unlink("a_list.nq")
```
